📋 **Introduction**  
This project demonstrates basic data manipulation and analysis techniques using the Pandas library. The Iris dataset is used as an example to showcase various data manipulation tasks such as loading data, cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis, and visualizing data.

✨ **Features**  
📂 Loads the Iris dataset using Pandas.  
🧹 Performs basic data cleaning and preprocessing.  
🔍 Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.  
📊 Visualizes data using matplotlib and seaborn.

🛠️ **Installation**  
To get started with the Basic Data Manipulation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/MRizwanMalik/Iris-Flower-mainpulation.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd Iris-Flower-mainpulation`

3. Install the required dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

🚀 **Usage**  
To use the Basic Data Manipulation notebook, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see Installation section).  
2. Place the `Iris.csv` file in the project directory.  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   `jupyter notebook Day3_Task2_Basic_Data_Manipulation.ipynb`  
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the dataset, perform data manipulation tasks, and visualize the results.

📊 **Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project is the Iris flower dataset. It consists of 150 observations of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is included in the project as `Iris.csv`.
